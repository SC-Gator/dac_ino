# Synapse
![A rendering of the Arduino shield](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/804931/13776151/e4bdfa4c-eaa8-11e5-8b88-48274cfd1437.png)
Synapse is an Arduino shield (and the corresponding library) which provides CV and Gate I/O for Arduino boards.

## Features
- 2 x control voltage inputs, 0 to 5V
- 2 x control voltage outputs, individually configurable as 0 to 10V or -5 to 5V via software, with 12bit of resolution
- 2 x gate inputs (with interrupt)
- 2 x gate outputs
- 1 x eurorack power connector (10 pin)
- A convenient wrapper library with high-level functions

## Usage
TBD

## Dependencies
- [DirectIO](https://github.com/mmarchetti/DirectIO), for fast digital pin access
